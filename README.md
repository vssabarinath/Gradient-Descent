GRADIENT DESCENT

AI-Based Cubic Equation Solver Using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and ReLU

This solver finds roots for cubic equations in the form 
洧녩洧논3+洧녪洧논2+洧녫洧논+洧녬=0ax 3 +bx 2 +cx+d=0, where 洧녩a, 洧녪b, 洧녫c, and 洧녬 are integers. 
It uses machine learning techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for optimization and the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function to handle non-linearity.

Key Features:
SGD Optimization:
The solver minimizes the error between the predicted and actual roots by iteratively adjusting 
x using SGD, an efficient method for finding solutions in complex problems.

ReLU Activation Function:
ReLU, defined as 洧녭(洧논)=max(0,洧논)
f(x)=max(0,x), introduces non-linearity and prevents the model from getting stuck in local minima, improving convergence.

Training Process:
The solver initializes coefficients and iteratively adjusts 
x using SGD and ReLU until the equation equals approximately zero.
